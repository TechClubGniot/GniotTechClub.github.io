                    Bluemix is an implementation of IBM's Open Cloud Architecture, based on Cloud Foundry, that enables you to rapidly create, deploy, and manage your cloud applications. Because Bluemix is based on Cloud Foundry, you can tap into a growing ecosystem of runtime frameworks and services. In addition to providing additional frameworks and services, Bluemix provides a dashboard for you to create, view, and manage your applications and services as well as monitor your application's resource usage. The Bluemix dashboard also provides the ability to manage organizations, spaces, and user access.

                    Bluemix provides access to a wide variety of services that can be incorporated into an application. Some of these services are delivered through Cloud Foundry. Others are delivered from IBM and third party vendors. New and enhanced services are added to the catalog often. To see the current list of runtimes and services, and their status go to the Bluemix catalog.

                    Some of the commonly used runtimes are:
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>Node.js</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>PHP</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>Python</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>Ruby</li>

                <h2 class="zaptitle"><span>What is Cloud Foundry?</span></h2>
                <p>Cloud Foundry is an open source platform as a service (PaaS) that lets you quickly create and deploy applications on the cloud.  Because of its open source roots, Cloud Foundry is not vendor specific and does not lock you into proprietary software or cloud infrastructure. Cloud Foundry abstracts the underlying infrastructure needed to run a cloud, letting you focus on the business of building cloud applications.  The beauty of Cloud Foundry is that it provides choice. Developers and organizations can choose:
                  <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>Development Frameworks:  Cloud Foundry supports Javaâ„¢ code, Spring, Ruby, Node.js, and custom frameworks.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>Application Services:  Cloud Foundry offers support for MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and custom services.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o"></i>Clouds:  Developers and organizations can choose to run Cloud Foundry in Public, Private, VMWare and OpenStack-based clouds.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                    Cloud Foundry's ability to provide choice comes through buildpacks, a convenient way to package frameworks and runtimes. Buildpacks can be community based, custom built, or built from scratch. In other words, if you cannot find a framework or service buildpack that suits your needs, you could modify an existing buildpack or create your own. By using buildpacks, companies are able to provide enterprise-level services like the Bluemix cloud offering.</p>
